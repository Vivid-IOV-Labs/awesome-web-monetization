                    <p class="font-weight-normal">"Let's have a really loud hand for the gallant losers - Bulgaria!"
                        Bagman shouted.</p>
                    <p class="font-weight-normal">
                        And up the stairs into the box came the seven defeated Bulgarian players. The crowd below was
                        applauding appreciatively; Harry could see thousands and thousands of Omniocular lenses flashing
                        and winking in their direction.
                        One by one, the Bulgarians filed between the rows of seats in the box, and Bagman called out the
                        name of each as they shook hands with their own minister and then with Fudge. Krum, who was last
                        in line, looked a real mess. Two black eyes were blooming spectacularly on his bloody face. He
                        was still holding the Snitch. Harry noticed that he seemed much less coordinated on the ground.
                        He was slightly duck-footed and distinctly round-shouldered. But when Krum's name was announced,
                        the whole stadium gave him a resounding, earsplitting roar.
                        And then came the Irish team. Aidan Lynch was being supported by Moran and Connolly; the second
                        crash seemed to have dazed him and his eyes looked strangely unfocused. But he grinned happily
                        as Troy and Quigley lifted the Cup into the air and the crowd below thundered its approval.
                        Harry's hands were numb with clapping.
                        At last, when the Irish team had left the box to perform another lap of honor on their brooms
                        (Aidan Lynch on the back of Confolly's, clutching hard around his waist and still grinning in a
                        bemused sort of way), Bagman pointed his wand at his throat and muttered, "Quietus."
                    </p>
                    <p class="font-weight-normal">
                        "They'll be talking about this one for years," he said hoarsely, "a really unexpected twist,
                        that. . . . shame it couldn't have lasted longer. . . . Ah yes... . yes, I owe you. . . how
                        much?"
                        For Fred and George had just scrambled over the backs of their seats and were standing in front
                        of Ludo Bagman with broad grins on their faces, their hands outstretched.
                        Don't tell your mother you've been gambling," Mr. Weasley implored Fred and George as they all
                        made their way slowly down the purple-carpeted stairs.
                        "Don't worry, Dad," said Fred gleefully, "we've got big plans for this money. We don't want it
                        confiscated."
                    </p>
                    <p class="font-weight-normal">
                        Mr. Weasley looked for a moment as though he was going to ask what these big plans were, but
                        seemed to decide, upon reflection, that he didn't want to know.
                        They were soon caught up in the crowds now flooding out of the stadium and back to their
                        campsites. Raucous singing was borne toward them on the night air as they retraced their steps
                        along the lantern-lit path, and leprechauns kept shooting over their heads, cackling and waving
                        their lanterns. When they finally reached the tents, nobody felt like sleeping at all, and given
                        the level of noise around them, Mr. Weasley agreed that they could all have one last cup of
                        cocoa together before turning in. They were soon arguing enjoyably about the match; Mr. Weasley
                        got drawn into a disagreement about cobbing with Charlie, and it was only when Ginny fell asleep
                        right at the tiny table and spilled hot chocolate all over the floor that Mr. Weasley called a
                        halt to the verbal replays and insisted that everyone go to bed. Hermione and Ginny went into
                        the next tent, and Harry and the rest of the Weasleys changed into pajamas and clambered into
                        their bunks. From the other side of the campsite they could still hear much singing and the odd
                        echoing bang.
                        "Oh I am glad I'm not on duty," muttered Mr. Weasley sleepily. "I wouldn't fancy having to go
                        and tell the Irish they've got to stop celebrating."
